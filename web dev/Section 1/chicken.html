    <h2>About Chickens</h2>
    <p>The chickenis a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon
        junglefowl that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a
        younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called
        a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.</p>
    <h2>More About Chickens</h2>
